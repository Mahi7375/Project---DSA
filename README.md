Data Structures Visualizer

This project is a visual representation of six fundamental data structures: Array, Stack, Queue, Circular Queue, Single Linked List, and Double Linked List. 
The main page of the application provides an interactive interface to perform basic operations on each of these data structures, allowing users to better understand their functionality and behavior.
The project helps in visualizing operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, making learning and practicing data structures more intuitive and engaging.
